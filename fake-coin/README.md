Scenario:
You are tasked with creating a program to detect a fake coin in a bag of coins. The weights of the coins are randomly generated by the system,
with one coin being lighter than the others.
Your program must:
```
1. Generate random weights for N coins.
2. Use a divide-and-weigh strategy to identify the fake coin.
3. Handle exceptions for cases where no fake coin exists.
```
Instructions:
```
1. Write a program that:
  - Generates random weights for N coins (e.g., integers between 10 and 20), ensuring one coin has a lower weight than the others.
  - Implements the divide-and-weigh strategy to identify the fake coin.
  - Simulates the weighing process step-by-step, showing which coins are being compared in each step.
  - Handles exceptions for:
    - Cases where all coins have the same weight (no fake coin).
    - Invalid data types during weight generation or comparison.
2. Allow the user to specify the number of coins N to generate.
3. Test your program with N = 8 and display the generated weights, the index of the fake coin, and the steps taken to identify it.
```
Guide Questions:
```
1. How will you ensure that exactly one coin is lighter than the others when generating random weights?
  - By assigning a separate variable to hold the fake weight where its value is subtracted by 1 of the real weight.

2. What happens if all coins have the same weight? How will you handle this edge case?
  - There is a function to check equality of each weight in the array.
    Using a for loop to verify if all weights are equal, returns true and ends the current problem.
    Otherwise, returns false where it will then be followed by a step-by-step process in finding the fake weight.

3. How does the divide-and-weigh strategy reduce the problem size by a constant factor at each step?
  - It is constantly reduced by half for each iteration such that,
    the total weights of both halves are weighed where the lighter would be taken for the next iteration until the counterfeit is found.

4. Can you think of a scenario where this algorithm might fail? If so, how would you address it?
  - The counterfeit weight is generated based on probability, if the program detects that all coins are genuine, it will repeat the program
    until it generates a fake one. This could take several resets if the probability leans toward not generating a counterfeit.
    To address this, we simply raise the chances of generating the fake weight. Or we could jump to a prompt that will give us
    the option to redo the problem.
